            <p>
                Water is of the utmost importance for Indigenous Peoples, their
                livelihoods, knowledge and cultural systems. UNESCO is one of the main
                UN Agencies engaged in water science, knowledge and policy. The LINKS
                programme of UNESCO is working to support Indigenous Peoples in the
                sharing of their key messages and case studies of water management,
                governance and rights issues.

        <h1>United Nations World Water Development Report</h1>
        <p>
            The United Nations World Water Development Report (UN WWDR) offers an
            authoritative and comprehensive assessment of the overall state, use and
            management of the worldâ€™s freshwater resources and aims to provide
            decision-makers with tools to formulate and implement sustainable water
            policies.</p>

        <p>The UN WWDR presents a balanced, fact-based and neutral
            account of the current state of knowledge, describing the challenges and
            opportunities of improved water management in the context of sustainable
            development. </p>

        <p> It highlights best practices and potential response options
            as well as in-depth theoretical analyses to help stimulate ideas and
            actions across various water-related sectors. The UN WWDR reports on
            progress towards achieving SDG 6 targets on clean water and sanitation
            as well as changes in the resource and its management. This is of great
            importance as water resources and how they are managed have a
            direct/indirect impact on almost all aspects of the 2030 Agenda for
            Sustainable Development.
